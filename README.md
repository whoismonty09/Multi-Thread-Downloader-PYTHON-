# ⬇️ Multi-threaded Downloader (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a multi-threaded file downloader using Java threads. Each file download runs in a separate thread to demonstrate concurrent execution and basic multithreading concepts.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Simulates multiple file downloads simultaneously  
- Each download runs in a separate thread  
- Displays download progress percentage  
- Demonstrates concurrent execution  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (Core Java)  
- Multithreading  
- Thread class  

---

## 📚 Concepts Applied
- Thread creation and execution  
- Parallel processing  
- Control flow in multithreaded programs  
- Synchronization basics  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Compile and run the Java program  
2. Observe multiple files downloading at the same time  
3. View progress updates in the console  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to use threads in Java  
- Understood concurrent execution  
- Practiced multi-threaded programming  
- Built a simple downloader simulation  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add real file download using URLs  
- Show total download time  
- Add pause and resume feature  
- GUI version using JavaFX
